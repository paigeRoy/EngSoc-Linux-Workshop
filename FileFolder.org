* How the file system works
- everything is a file
  - bin is for binaries of small systems, used by the whol system
  - boot is how the system boots
  - etc is the system wide config area
  - lib folders are where libraries are stored, required by bin
  - mnt is where to find other mounted drives (usually manually)
  - opt manually installed software from other vendors is placed,
    place to install applications created yourself, like windows path
  - proc places to store system files which update based on processes active
  - home is where users files, document and configs are stored
  - root is the root users home folder
  - run temporary file system (stuff stored entirely in ram)
  - sys the system folder is created each boot up and can be edited by programs
    to interact with the systems kernal
  - usr folder is where applications installed by the user will be
  - var is the variable directory. holds data that is expected to increase, such
    as system logs and databases for mail
  - hidden directories start with a period
