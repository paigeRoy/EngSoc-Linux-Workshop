  + Smaller parts make the whole

- Customizability (also user management is somewhat related)
- how the file system works

- Talk about stability vs rolling release software
  + Show the wiki for either arch or debian
General overview of what to cover
1) Show how to create a user and log in

     + Use grep to filter the text steam
     + Send to sed and format the 
     + Maybe use awk for somethin
7) Show how to compile code from source in the terminal

     + SAMBA
     + SSH
   - More ways to configure system
     + Any other locations where config files are stored
And then thats the end of the interactive section
